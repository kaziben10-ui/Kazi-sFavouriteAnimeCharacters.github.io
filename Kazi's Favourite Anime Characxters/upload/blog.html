				<h3><a href="singlepost.html">DENJI AND REZE</a></h3>
				<span>AGE OF BOTH, 16 YEARS OLD </span>
				<p>
					Denji and Reze are amazing together because they see each other beyond powers or pain. Both struggle with loneliness, yet when they’re together, they feel understood and free. Their playful moments show a rare peace in Denji’s chaotic life, and Reze’s smile reveals the softness she hides. Even in a world of betrayal and danger, their connection feels warm, human, and unforgettable.

				<h3><a href="singlepost.html">LUFFY GEAR 5TH</a></h3>
				<span>AGE, 19 YEARS OLD </span>
				<p>
					Luffy doesn’t just chase a dream — he inspires others to believe in theirs.
He fears nothing when it comes to protecting his friends.
His strength isn’t just in his fists, but in his heart.
A pirate with the spirit of a true king — that’s why Luffy is the GOAT.

				<h3><a href="singlepost.html">FRIEREN</a></h3>
				<span>AGE, OVER 1000 YEARS </span>
				<p>
					Frieren is a character who reminds us that time means nothing without the moments we share. She has lived for centuries, yet only begins to understand human emotion after the people she cared about are gone. Her quiet journey is filled with reflection, growth, and the desire to cherish what she once overlooked. Through her calm strength and gentle curiosity, she shows that even the most distant heart can learn to love and appreciate life again. Frieren’s story is beautifully timeless.

				<img src="c:\Users\user\Downloads\Kazi's Favourite Anime Characxters\upload\images\Albedo.jpg" alt="Albedo">
				<h3><a href="singlepost.html">ALBEDO</a></h3>
				<span>AGE, AROUND 20-25 </span>
				<p>
					Albedo is an incredible character because she balances elegance, loyalty, and absolute chaos in the most entertaining way. As the Overseer of the Floor Guardians, she holds immense authority and intelligence, commanding respect with her strategic mind and unwavering devotion to Ainz. Yet beneath her graceful and composed exterior is a fierce, comedic, and deeply passionate personality that makes her unforgettable. Her love for Ainz isn’t just a gimmick — it shows how deeply she values purpose, belonging, and emotion despite being a created NPC. Albedo embodies beauty, power, and personality in perfect harmony, making her one of Overlord’s most iconic and beloved characters.
